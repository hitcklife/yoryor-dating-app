## üß™ Testing Results

### API Endpoints Verified ‚úÖ
- **Profile API**: Successfully tested with bearer token
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "id": 503,
      "user_id": 503,
      "first_name": "Abraham",
      "last_name": "Lincoln",
      "bio": "Bdjdje dhdjdi djdn",
      "city": "Freeport",

    }
  }
  ```

- **Video Call Token API**: Successfully tested
  ```json
  {
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
    "success": true
  }
  ```

## üì± User Experience Improvements
